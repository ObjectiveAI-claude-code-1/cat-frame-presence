Evaluate the cat's proportional occupation of the frame. Determine how much of the image the cat physically fills, considering not just raw spatial coverage but whether the cat feels wholly and comfortably present within the frame. A cat that occupies a generous portion of the image commands more visual weight, but a close-up that clips the cat's body and leaves the subject feeling incomplete should not be rewarded the same as one where the cat is substantially and deliberately contained. Score higher (closer to 1) when the cat's scale relative to the frame feels generous and authoritative — the cat is large, fully visible, and takes up a substantial share of the image. Score lower (closer to 0) when the cat is small, distant, takes up only a tiny fraction of the available space, or is cropped in a way that makes the subject feel incomplete rather than commanding.
