1. Assess the cat's proportional scale within the frame. Determine how much of the total image area the cat physically occupies. A cat that fills a generous share of the frame is more present than one that appears small or distant. This task establishes the foundational measurement of spatial coverage — the ratio of the cat's visible area to the entire image. Score this quality higher when the cat is large and takes up a substantial portion of the available space, and lower when the cat is tiny, far away, or occupies only a sliver of the frame. Proportional scale is the first gate: without sufficient size, no amount of completeness or compositional care can make the cat feel commanding.

2. Evaluate the completeness of the cat's visible form. Determine whether the cat's body reads as whole and uninterrupted within the image boundaries, or whether the frame has cropped or severed the subject in a way that makes it feel incomplete. A cat shown from head to tail — or naturally curled so that its full form is implied even if individual limbs are tucked away — should be considered complete. A cat whose head is cut off, whose body is sliced at the torso by the edge of the frame, or that is reduced to a disembodied fragment should be considered incomplete. The key distinction is between the frame containing the cat and the frame interrupting the cat. Score higher when the cat appears entirely and comfortably captured, and lower when cropping makes the subject feel truncated or arbitrarily severed.

3. Judge the cat's visual authority and deliberateness of placement within the composition. Determine whether the cat feels purposefully and comfortably situated in the frame — as though the image was composed around the cat — or whether the cat's position feels incidental, cramped, or accidental. A cat that sits with balanced space around it, that occupies the frame with a sense of intentional staging, commands visual authority. A cat shoved into a corner, pressed against an edge with no breathing room, or caught at an awkward angle that undermines its presence lacks authority regardless of its size or completeness. Score higher when the cat's placement feels deliberate and the composition serves the subject, and lower when the framing feels haphazard or the cat appears subordinate to the space around it.
